<p>So, you&#8217;re sat in your flat, hungover, with a 2-hour lecture ahead of you. It is a tough situation, however before you contemplate skipping the lecture so you can lounge about in a groggy state, there are some University rules and regulations regarding attendance that you should know.<br />
The following sums up the official rules and regulations of Newcastle University that can be found on the <a href='http://www.ncl.ac.uk/students/progress/Regulations/SPS/Attendance/'>University&#8217;s page about absence.</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>Students are expected to turn up to all lectures, seminars etc. If you cannot attend any element of your course, you should submit a <a href='http://www.ncl.ac.uk/students/progress/Regulations/SPS/Attendance/'>Student Notification of Absence Form.</a></li>
	
	<li>If you have any difficulties or queries concerning absence, you should contact your tutor and he/she should be able to support you.</li>
	
	<li>If you miss anything, it is your responsibility to catch up! <a href='https://blackboard.ncl.ac.uk/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp'>Blackboard</a> can be used to view the notes that you missed, or you can use Re-Cap to go through the whole lecture.</li>

	<li>Assume, your lectures will be on during standard term time. For example, if you have heard a strike will occur during University hours, you should be contacted by your lecturer or someone from your course to inform you if your lecture is cancelled. Don&#8217;t just assume it is.</li>
	
		<li>Attendance in lectures is recorded by either a sign-in sheet, which you physically have to sign, or by scanning your university card into a scanner which should be provided.</li>

	<li>If you submit a Student Notification of Absence Form, don&#8217;t always assume it will be authorised. The situation at the top of the screen for example may not be taken too seriously!</li>

	<li>If you are an international student, because of Home Office rules, you are expected to attend at least 80% of your classes.</li>
</ol>



<p>There are some other rules regarding post-graduate study that once again can be found on the <a href='http://www.ncl.ac.uk/students/progress/Regulations/SPS/Attendance/'>University&#8217;s page about absence.</a></p>


<p>REMEMBER: You have chosen to be here, and are paying a significant amount of money for your course. If you still struggle to make those 9 o&#8217;clocks, then maybe that will stir you!</p>
