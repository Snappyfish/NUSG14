<h1>CLEARING!</h1>

<p class='redtextpara'>Were you unsuccessful in securing a place at University after your A level results day?</p>

<p>If your application to Newcastle University was via UCAS then you can check vacancies for courses. If any of the courses interest you then you can phone the hotline and find out if you may join that course. </p>

<p>Hotline:<br />
Telephone: (0191) 222 6000<br /></p>

<p>Clearing is <span class='redtext'>highly competitive</span> hence it&#8217;s wise to check the website in the fortnight leading up to the A level results day to find out about process and how to prepare.<br />

Clearing will be open once the A-Level results are released. </p>

<h1>ADJUSTMENT!</h1>

<p><span class='redtextpara'>Do you wish to change your choice of course due to better results?</span><br />

You may change your course or university, several days after the A-level results day. If youâ€™ve received a higher grade than expected then you may apply to other courses or universities. </p>
